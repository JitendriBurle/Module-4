# Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)
### Q. Explain the role of Frontend (FE) in a web application. Include points related to:
* User interface
* User interaction
* Communication with backend

##### Ans. Frontend Development in web application is the process of creating user interface of a website.Frontend helps users to interact with the website and allows communication with backend.Some of the tools that can be used in frontend development are Html, Css, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, etc.
* Html is used for creating the structure and elements to be used in a website.
* CSS is used for styling and designing the website.
* JavaScript is used for creating the logic and interaction.
* React is a library which is used for building dynamic UIs.
* Angular and Vue are the frameworks through which we can develop frontend applications.

# Q2. Role of Backend (BE)
### Q. Explain the role of Backend (BE) in a web application. Include points related to:

* Server-side processing
* Database handling
* Security and authentication

##### Ans. Backend development handles the server-side logic, database, and core functionality of web applications. It ensures smooth communication between the server and client using languages and frameworks like Node.js, Django, and Spring.The backend is connected to security and authentication by acting as the central "gatekeeper" and data manager for an application.It is the backbone of web applications.The technologies used are Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, SQL databases.

* Python is a programming language used for backend development with its framworks like Django, Flask.
* Java is a programming language used for creating reliable backend and is scalable.It uses the framworks like Springboot.
* Ruby is loved for its clean, readable syntax that makes it easy to write and maintain backend code. 
* PHP is one of the oldest and most widely used languages for web development.It is a powerful tool for building complex backend systems.
* Node.js is a runtime environment for javascript allowing backend developers to use the same language across both the frontend and backend.
* SQL is a database system which is used to store, organize, and manage data that is used by the application.

# Q3. Business Logic
### Q. What is Business Logic? Explain in detail and give at least 3 real-world examples where business logic is applied in a web application.

##### Ans. The set of guidelines that determine how a web application should function is known as business logic. It regulates the processing of data and what users are permitted to do.It controls how data is processed as well as what users can do.It ensures that every action complies with the company's real-world regulations by positioning itself between the frontend and the database.

As an example,

* Online shopping: figuring out how much it will cost overall, applying savings, and looking at stock.
* Banking app: Ensuring that the user has sufficient funds and complies with transfer restrictions.
* School portal: Only permitting registration for courses after dues has been cleared. 

# Q4. Client–Server Model
### Q. What is the Client–Server Model? Explain:

* Who is the client
* Who is the server
* How communication happens between them

The Client-Server Model is a distributed architecture where clients request services and servers provide them. It underpins many modern systems, including websites, email, and cloud storage platforms.

How Does the Client-Server Model Work?
Client: A client is any device or software that initiates communication by requesting data or services from a server. Common client applications include:

Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

Email apps (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)

Server: A server is a powerful systems that listens for and responds to client requests by delivering data or performing tasks. Servers often handle multiple simultaneous client requests. Common server applications include:

Web Servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
Email Servers
Database servers

How the Browser Interacts With the Servers?
The process of interacting with servers through a browser involves several steps:

1. User Enters the URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
The user types a website address (e.g., www.example.com) into the browser's address bar.

2. DNS (Domain Name System) Lookup:
The browser contacts a DNS server to convert the domain into an IP address.

3. Establishing a Connection:
The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server using the resolved IP address.

4. Server Responds:
The server sends back website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).

5. Browser Renders the Webpage

DOM interpreter: Processes HTML to structure the page.
CSS interpreter: Applies styles
JavaScript Engine: Adds interactivity (using JIT compilation for performance).
